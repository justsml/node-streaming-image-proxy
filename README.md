# Node.js Streaming Proxy

## Description

This is a **reference quality** streaming proxy server that can be used to proxy content from a source URL to the browser.

It is written in TypeScript and uses Express.js as the web server.

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

## Overview

This project solves a common & poorly documented challenge: **using node.js to stream media from a (hidden) source URL to a browser or native clients.**

### The Scenario

Let's say we have an e-commerce site with **10's of millions of products.** Each product may have **up to 100 photos.** Bottom line: we need to **support a BILLION+ photos!**

Every week 80% of all **primary** photos are requested.
The vast majority of those 'additional' photos are rarely requested. Who really looks at the 88th photo of a product?

We need a streaming image proxy, that meets the following requirements:

### Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Streaming** - For minimal memory usage.
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Resizing, Quality & Format** - To reduce client data over the wire.
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Buffering** - Optimize server load given many tiny reqs.
- ‚úÖ Hide source URL details (protect vendor or partner names.)
- üí™ ~~Excellent~~ Better coding patterns!
- ‚ùå No sync/cron jobs.
- ‚ùå On-demand.
- ‚ùå No long-term caching. Avoid stale data.
- ‚ùå No need to store images locally.

### Ideas

A list of related things I've worked on previously - some might just might make sense to include in this project.

- [x] Few files.
- [x] Minimal dependencies.
- [ ] Image filters?
- [ ] Watermark?
- [ ] Credit?
- [ ] EXIF scrubbing?
- [ ] [Benchmarks.](#benchmarks)
- [ ] Video streaming? Byte chunking?
- [ ] Text streaming? (support for ChatGPT or similar services)?

### API Endpoints

- `/img/:product_id/:photo_index`
- `/img/:product_id/:photo_index/:resize`

### Example

- `/img/42/1` - returns the first image for product 42.
- `/img/42/1/200x200` - returns the first image for product 42 resized to 200x200.
- `/img/614/3` - returns the third image for product 614.
- `/img/614/3/50%` - returns the third image for product 614 resized to 50% of the original size.
- `/img/614/3/200w` - returns the third image for product 614 resized to 200 pixels wide.

## Notes

### Supporting Data

The following is a sample of the data that is used to support the API.

It's okay if you store your photos slightly differently, for example in a JSONB or Array column.
Only minor adjustments would be needed in the [ProductsApi](src/productsApi.ts) module.

> Two products with 2 and 5 images respectively.

| product_id | media_rank | url                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 42         | 1          | https://picsum.photos/1024 |
| 42         | 2          | https://picsum.photos/1024 |
| 614        | 1          | https://picsum.photos/1024 |
| 614        | 2          | https://picsum.photos/1024 |
| 614        | 3          | https://picsum.photos/1024 |
| 614        | 4          | https://picsum.photos/1024 |
| 614        | 5          | https://picsum.photos/1024 |

### Testing

<!-- 
To simulate slow networks, you can use the `throttle` package.

```sh
npm install throttle
```

```ts
import * as Throttle from 'throttle'
const maxSpeedInMBs = 0.5
const throttle = new Throttle(1024 * 1024 * maxSpeedInMBs) // throttle to 0.5MB/sec

// instead of returning the readStream directly,
return readStream.pipe(throttle)
``` 
-->

#### CLI Testing

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/42/1
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/42/1/200x200
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/614/3
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/614/3/50w
```

### Benchmarks

#### [TL;DR Show Results](#results-un-buffered)

First, start the server with logging disabled.

```sh
DISABLE_LOGGING=true npm run start
```

Next, use your favorite benchmarking tool to hammer away at your service.

#### Results: Un-buffered

_Note:_ Testing on a 2022 MacBook Air, M2, 24GB RAM.

When source images are [600px](https://picsum.photos/600) converting to `500px`, we can hit 80/reqs/sec.

```sh
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/img/614/3/500
