# Node.js Streaming Proxy

## Description

This is a **reference quality** streaming proxy server that can be used to proxy content from a source URL to the browser.

It is written in TypeScript and uses Express.js as the web server.

```sh
npm i
npm start
```

## Design

Let's say we have an e-commerce site with **10's of millions of products.** Each product may have **up to 100 photos.** Bottom line: we need to support a BILLION+ photos!

We don't want to store all of these photos on our server. Instead, we want to lookup the desired URL in our DB & start streaming the image from the server to the browser. Which has a bonus effect of hiding any vendor or partner names from source URLs.

- [x] ~~Excellent~~ Better coding patterns!
- [x] Dynamic resizing!
- [ ] Dynamic buffering!
- [x] Few files.
- [x] Minimal dependencies.
- [ ] [Benchmarks.](#benchmarks)
- [ ] Video streaming? Byte chunking?
- [ ] Text streaming (support for ChatGPT or similar services)?

### Supporting Data

> Two products with 2 and 5 images respectively.

| product_id | media_rank | url |
|------------|------------|-----|
| 42        | 1  | example.com/900/1 |
| 42        | 2  | example.com/900/2 |
| 614       | 1  | acme.example.com/614/1 |
| 614       | 2  | acme.example.com/614/2 |
| 614       | 3  | acme.example.com/614/3 |
| 614       | 4  | acme.example.com/614/4 |
| 614       | 5  | acme.example.com/614/5 |

### API Endpoints

- `/img/:product_id/:photo_index`
- `/img/:product_id/:photo_index/:resize`

### Example

- `/img/42/1` - returns the first image for product 42.
- `/img/42/1/200x200` - returns the first image for product 42 resized to 200x200.
- `/img/614/3` - returns the third image for product 614.
- `/img/614/3/50%` - returns the third image for product 614 resized to 50% of the original size.
- `/img/614/3/200w` - returns the third image for product 614 resized to 200 pixels wide.

## Notes

### Testing

To simulate slow networks, you can use the `throttle` package.

```sh
npm install throttle
```

```ts
import * as Throttle from 'throttle';
const maxSpeedInMBs = 0.5;
const throttle = new Throttle(1024 * 1024 * maxSpeedInMBs); // throttle to 0.5MB/sec

// instead of returning the readStream directly,
return readStream.pipe(throttle);
```

#### CLI Testing

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/42/1
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/42/1/200x200
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/614/3
curl -v http://localhost:3000/img/614/3/50w
```

### Benchmarks

Test using your favorite benchmarking tool: [ab](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html), [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk), [autocannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon), [siege](https://www.joedog.org/siege-home/), [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey).

```sh
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/img/42/1
autocannon -c 100 -d 5 -p 10 http://localhost:3000/img/42/1/500x500
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:3000/img/42/1
siege -c 100 -t 30s http://localhost:3000/img/42/1/200x200
hey -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/img/42/1/1024w
```

#### Results: Un-buffered

Using a 2022 MacBook Air, M2 chip, 24GB RAM.

When source images are limited to [600px](https://picsum.photos/600) we can hit 80/reqs/sec.

If the image size doubles to [1200px](https://picsum.photos/1200), the throughput drops to roughly 26-30/reqs/sec.

```sh
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/img/614/3/500
